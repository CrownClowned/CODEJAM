Reversort is an algorithm to sort a list of distinct integers in increasing order. The algorithm is based on the "Reverse" operation. Each application of this operation reverses the order of some contiguous part of the list.

The pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:

Reversort(L):
  for i := 1 to length(L) - 1
    j := position with the minimum value in L between i and length(L), inclusive
    Reverse(L[i..j])
After i−1 iterations, the positions 1,2,…,i−1 of the list contain the i−1 smallest elements of L, in increasing order. During the i-th iteration, the process reverses the sublist going from the i-th position to the current position of the i-th minimum element. That makes the i-th minimum element end up in the i-th position.
